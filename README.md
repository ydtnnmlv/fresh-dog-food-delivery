## FAQ

**How do I transition my dog to fresh food without upsetting their stomach?**

Start slowly by mixing 10% fresh food with 90% current food for the first two days, then gradually increase the fresh food ratio by 10% every two days over 10 days. This allows your dog's digestive system to adjust to the richer nutrient profile. Watch for loose stools and slow down the transition if needed.

**Will fresh dog food really make a visible difference in my dog's health?**

Most pet parents report noticeable improvements within 2-4 weeks, including shinier coat, more consistent energy levels, better breath, and healthier bowel movements. Fresh food offers higher bioavailability of nutrients compared to heavily processed kibble, meaning your dog absorbs more of what they eat.

**How do I know fresh dog food is actually safer than kibble?**

Look for brands that meet AAFCO nutritional standards and follow WSAVA guidelines with board-certified veterinary nutritionists on staff. Fresh food prepared in human-grade kitchens follows USDA safety protocols rather than looser pet food manufacturing standards. Check that companies use high-pressure processing or proper cooking methods to eliminate harmful bacteria.
